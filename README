This is a fork of Baron Schwartz's date formatting and parsing library.  I
added namespacing, simplified the function generators, wrote unit tests, and
fixed some bugs. It no longer installs anything onto Date's prototype.  It
remains under the LPGL. I would like to stress that all the core design ideas
(namely the code generator approach) and legwork of implementing the many
different formatting flags are his; I'm simply doing some clean-up to ensure
that the libary is up to recent JS library standards.

Baron's original README follow:
This is a JavaScript date parsing and formatting library, date-functions.js.
